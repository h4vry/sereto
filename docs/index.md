In a *penetration test*, the **reporting** phase is considered one of the most crucial aspects. It serves as the *final deliverable*, yet it is often met with *disdain*. This phase is *time-consuming* and lacks excitement, making it less appealing.

SeReTo offers a *solution* by enabling the creation of *semi-automated* penetration testing reports. This tool significantly reduces the time spent on writing reports and ensures consistency across the entire team.
